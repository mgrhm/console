 *
 *  h1 is exactly twice the point size of body text (28pt to 14pt).
 *  Until h5, each subsequent step down in h2 is 4pt smaller than the
 *  previous one (h1 = 28pt, h2 = 24pt, and so on).
 *
 *  h5 is 14pt -- only 2pt smaller than h4 and the same size as body
 *  text.  The use of bold IBM Plex Sans differentiates it from body.
 *
 *  The line-height is the point-size +6pt (h1: 28 + 6 = 34pt).  This is
 *  also true for h5.
 *
 *  I haven't defined h6 because it's almost never used.
