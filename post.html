<h1>Onion Samson Strikes Again, and Wins! It’s His Pattern – and He
    Never Breaks It</h1>

    <p>My self-built 2013 gaming rig (3770K @ 4.0Ghz,
       16<abbr title="Gigabytes">Gb</abbr> DDR3, GeForce 670) has
       struggled these past few years. DOOM (2016) especially, has been
       painful to play at potato settings.</p>

    <p>Having spent the last couple of years hemming and hawing over
    upgrading, a close friend got in touch for advice on maxing out (era
    appropriate) his 2009 Mac Pro (not for gaming). <a
    href="http://google.com">These <em>can</em> take</a> a GeForce 680,
    780, even a Titan or Titan X with default OS support.</p>

<h2>Onion Samson Strikes Again, and Wins! It’s His Pattern – and He
    Never Breaks It!</h2>

    <p>Scoping out eBay for them, I started thinking, well now, maybe I
    could find one for me too. The green-eyed monster was just too much
        for me.  Goaded on, I narrowly won an <a
            href="https://www.msi.com">MSI GeForce 980 ti Gaming
            (6gb)</a> and went from playing <em>DOOM</em> (2016) on
        potato mode to playing at 2560x1440 with all the advanced video
        settings turned up to the max.  For £193 ($240) inc.  postage, I
        can play all the current modern games at 60<abbr title="frames
            per second">fps+</abbr> on high/ultra at 1440p.</p>

    <p>As I’d discussed <a 
        href="https://onionsamson.com/almanac/castlevania/">in my 
        review</a> of <em>Castelvania: Symphony of the Night</em>:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The year was 1998 and <em>Castlevania: Symphony of
            the Night</em> (<em>SOTN</em>) was my first
        <em>Castlevania</em> and <em>Metroid</em>-like experience. It
        came to me unprompted.  A school-friend ponied it up after his
        kid-sister scratched up another PlayStation game I had loaned
        him. (I cannot for the life of me remember now the game I loaned
        him.)</p>

        <p>At school, there were three-inch by three-inch square posts
        embedded into the wood-working class tables. With your hand, you
        could push them up from underneath for comedic effect. This
        school friend was quite cherubic and kind-hearted, the son of
        two accountants. He was however so named by these aspirational
        parents, that I made the connection with his double-barrelled
        name and the rising table wood.  In a stroke of <a 
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lulz">pubescent 
        wit</a>, he was for a week or so after known to me as
        “Erec-tion”.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>As an aesthete, I appreciated the beautiful artwork on the
    double-decker jewel CD case. Painted in the classical style I am now
    familiar with across the Final Fantasy titles. Within the casing,
    the game CD and instruction book lay at the front section, and a
    separate audio CD and artbook in the back section. I could barely
    hide my enthusiasm upon receiving this boon.</p>

    <p>On booting up, I poured over the gothic lettering and haunting
    choir background music. First impressions were sky-high. Excuse me
    if the sequencing that follows is incorrect, but I recall the
    era-appropriate voice-acting (quite awful) and rolling text intro
    beginning the game, punctuated by a chunk of full-motion video,
    including an only partially textured castle (thankfully, the
    attention to detail in the actual game was not subject to such
    sacrifice).</p>

<h3>Onion Samson Strikes Again, and Wins! It’s His Pattern – and He
    Never Breaks It! He Is Consistent, Boring, But Reliable!</h3>

    <p>With VSYNC off I am now able to enjoy 190fps(!) in DOOM (2016),
    though my monitor is only 60hz… for now.</p>

    <p>I realise the GeForce 2060 is £300 ($372) vs the £193 ($240) I
    spent on a five year old card.</p>

    <p>…And that would’ve been better for future proofing.</p>

    <p>…And that next year’s cards will probably take a huge leap
    forward due to impending consoles. But…I am happy as Leisure Suit
    Larry with my new old 980 ti.</p>

<h4>Onion Samson Strikes Again, and Wins! It’s His Pattern – and He
    Never Breaks It! He Is Consistent, Boring, But Reliable! He Is
    Consistent, Boring, But Reliable!</h4>

    <p>It fits well with the rest of my older hardware and should keep
    on trucking until I eventually build a whole new machine 2–5 years
    from now.</p>

    Commenting the following lines in the startup-sequence (by inserting a semi-colon at the start of the lines) allowed the system to load, but when I then double-clicked a WHDload game to run it, the task bar at the top of workbench would quickly flash “attempting to load[…]”, but nothing further happened:

    <p>Bingo! Worked a treat. Now most of my Amiga woes are gone. Though I
    could do with more fully-functioning RAM…and a couple of zip-sticks for
    Sensible Soccer…and an old CRT TV for authenticity (and for Playstation 1
    and Sega Saturn light gun games)…and…</p>
