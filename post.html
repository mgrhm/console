<h1>Onion Samson Strikes Again, and Wins! It’s His Pattern – and He
    Never Breaks It</h1>

    <p>My self-built 2013 gaming rig (3770K @ 4.0Ghz, 16<abbr
                                                            title="Gigabytes">Gb</abbr> DDR3, GeForce 670)
    has struggled these past few years. DOOM (2016) especially, has been
    painful to play at potato settings.</p>

    <p>Having spent the last couple of years hemming and hawing over
    upgrading, a close friend got in touch for advice on maxing out (era
    appropriate) his 2009 Mac Pro (not for gaming). <a
    href="http://google.com">These <em>can</em> take</a> a GeForce 680,
    780, even a Titan or Titan X with default OS support.</p>

<h2>Onion Samson Strikes Again, and Wins! It’s His Pattern – and He
    Never Breaks It!</h2>

    <p>Scoping out eBay for them, I started thinking, well now, maybe I could
    find one for me too. The green-eyed monster was just too much for me.
        Goaded on, I narrowly won an <a
                                         href="https://www.msi.com/Graphics-card/GTX-980-Ti-GAMING-6G.html">MSI
                                         GeForce 980 ti Gaming (6gb)</a> and
                                     went from playing <em>DOOM</em> (2016) on
                                     potato mode to playing at 2560x1440 with
                                     all the advanced video settings turned up
                                     to the max.  For £193 ($240) inc.
                                     postage, I can play all the current
                                     modern games at 60<abbr title="frames per
                                     second">fps+</abbr>  on high/ultra at
                                 1440p.</p>

<h3>Onion Samson Strikes Again, and Wins! It’s His Pattern – and He
    Never Breaks It! He Is Consistent, Boring, But Reliable!</h3>

    <p>With VSYNC off I am now able to enjoy 190fps(!) in DOOM (2016), though
    my monitor is only 60hz… for now.</p>

    <p>I realise the GeForce 2060 is £300 ($372) vs the £193 ($240) I
    spent on a five year old card.</p>

    <p>…And that would’ve been better for
    future proofing.</p>

    <p>…And that next year’s cards will probably take a
    huge leap forward due to impending consoles. But…I am happy as
    Leisure Suit Larry with my new old 980 ti.</p>

<h4>Onion Samson Strikes Again, and Wins! It’s His Pattern – and He
    Never Breaks It! He Is Consistent, Boring, But Reliable! He Is
    Consistent, Boring, But Reliable!</h4>

    <p>It fits well with the rest of my older hardware and should keep
    on trucking until I eventually build a whole new machine 2–5 years
    from now.</p>
